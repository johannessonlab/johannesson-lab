After completing his PhD at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU) in September 2008, Nicklas received a grant from Sven and Lilly Lawski foundation to start a two and a half year period as a post-doc in the group. He was particularly interested in nuclear imbalances in the mycelium and perithecia of developing Neurospora tetrasperma individuals, as well as mating-type specific gene expression in Neurospora. He returned to SLU in 2011 and is now Business Policy Manager at Sveriges Allmänningsskogars Förbund.
