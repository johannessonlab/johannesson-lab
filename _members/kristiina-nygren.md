Kristiina did her PhD with Hanna as main advisor, on the topic of reproductive systems in Neurospora. She graduated in 2011, and in the fall of 2015, she reentered the group in the third year of her VR-funded postdoc concerning imprinting in the basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune, in which she studied the effects of parental origin on gene expression and methylation in the fungal heterokaryon. Kristiina has now taken on a job as scientist at FOI.
