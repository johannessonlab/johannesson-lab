# The evolution of fungal genomes and its association with life history traits and extreme environments
The Johannesson lab is placed at the [Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant sciences](https://www.su.se/department-of-ecology-environment-and-plant-sciences/), at [Stockholm university](https://www.su.se/), since May 2022. Hanna Johannesson is the current holder of the [professor Bergianus title](https://www.kva.se/en/about-us/organisation/institutes-and-academy-programmes/) at the [Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences](https://www.kva.se/en). Before that, Hanna lead a research group at [Uppsala university](https://www.uu.se/en) since becoming an independent PI in 2005.

Our lab conducts research using fungi as model systems to explore fundamental evolutionary questions such as individuality, multilevel selection, and the drivers of genetic variation.

# Highlights

{% capture text %}
We study fungal life history traits and explore general evolutionary questions such as natural selection operating at multiple levels in the biological hierarchy, the causes and consequences of symbioses and switches in reproductive mode. We also study fungi from extreme environments, and their genomic adaptations. As tools we use comparative genomics, population genetics, bioinformatics, and laboratory experiments.
