I'm an industrial PhD student hired by the [LKAB mine company](https://lkab.com/en/) and studying via Stockholm University. My project's main focus is  describing the diversity and activity of oil degrading fungi and bacteria present in Kiruna underground mine with the long term goal of implementing new and sustainable industrial waste treatment methods.
