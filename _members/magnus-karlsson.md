After receiving his PhD at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (SLU), Magnus came to our group in the spring of 2005 for a one year post-doc (financed by the Carl Trygger Foundation). He worked primarily with analyses of expression of the genes encoding pheromones and their receptors in intra- and interspecific matings of Neurospora. He is now back at SLU as a researcher.
