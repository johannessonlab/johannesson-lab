I am professor in mycology. I am the holder of the Bergianus professorship, appointed by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and with placement at DEEP. I established my own independent research group at Uppsala University in 2005, after a PhD at the Swedish Agricultural University and a postdoc at University of California at Berkeley. I achieved an Associate Professorship (docentur) in 2006 and between 2007 and 2013 I held a senior research position (rådsforskartjänst) funded by the Swedish Research Council (VR). Since December 2013 I am a full professor.
