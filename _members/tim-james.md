After a PhD and post-doc at Duke University, Tim joined the group as a Wenner-Gren post-doc during 2006 and 2007. During his post-doc in Uppsala Tim studied the evolutionary significance of imbalanced nuclear ratios within heterokaryons of the basidiomycete fungus _Heterobasidion parviporum_. Now, Tim has his own lab at the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Michigan.
