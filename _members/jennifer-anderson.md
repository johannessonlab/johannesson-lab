Jennifer was studying how organisms achieve different rates and types (e.g. interspecific or intraspecific) of genetic exchange and the consequnces of this. She explored these issues in two experimentally tractable fungi, _N. tetrasperma_ and _N. crassa_. Using experimental and experimental evolution approaches, she quantified the performance effects of interspecific introgression on the mating type chromosome of N. tetrasperma, and looked for tradeoffs associated with different reproductive roles in _N. crassa_. Jennifer has now started her own lab at the Systematic biology program at EBC.
