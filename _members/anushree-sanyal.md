Anushree came to the group in February 2016, for a 2 year postdoc. She was exploring the genomes of Neurospora for structural variants. These can be analyzed from a comparative and population genomic framework to address general aspects of genome evolution and connect them to processes such as genome size evolution, mating system evolution, speciation and meiotic drive. Anushree is currently a researcher at SLU.
