Pádraic graduated from Hanna's group in November 2013 with the thesis: "Neurospora tetrasperma from natural populations: toward the population genomics of a model fungus". His PhD was anchored in the fields of population genetics and molecular evolution. His main research focus concerned understanding the evolutionary forces that shape the patterns of polymorphism within and between species. He is now working at the Array Platform in Uppsala.
