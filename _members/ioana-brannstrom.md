Ioana graduated as a PhD in June 2017, with Hanna Johannesson as main supervisor and Leif Tibell as second supervisor. Her research subject concerned a special group within the fungal world: the symbiotic fungi called LICHENS. She focused her study on investigating the life history and world phylogeography of the arctic and alpine lichen Thamnolia vermicularis. By using this species as model organisms and by combining genomic, ecologic and evolutionary methods she strived to disentangle the mechanisms behind lichen symbiosis. Ioana has now moved on to a postdoc with Fabien Burki, at Uppsala university.
