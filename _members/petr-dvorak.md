Petr joined Hanna Johannessonâ€™s group in November 2016 for one year. Petr investigated genome landscapes using population genomics tools and a demographic history of putative species within filamentous fungus Neurospora tetrasperma. These data will contribute to our understanding of speciation patterns and evolutionary history in fungi. Petr is currently back as a researcher in Palacky University Olomouc.
