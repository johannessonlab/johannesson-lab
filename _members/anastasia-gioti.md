Anastasia was a post-doc with Hanna from 2009 to 2011, on a Carl Trygger fellowship. She was using different species of the fungal genus Neurospora to study the evolution of reproductive systems, as reflected at the genome level, with a particular focus on transposable elements. Her research focused on obligate selfing taxa of the genus and spanned bioinformatics, molecular evolution and gene expression approaches. Anastasia is currently a researcher at the Hellenic Center for Marine Research, Greece.
