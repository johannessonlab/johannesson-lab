Lore joined Hanna’s group as a PhD-student in the fall of 2015 and graduated in May 2020. Her main focus for the PhD was on the population dynamics of fungal meiotic drive elements (the Spore killers), in particular under which circumstances they may invade a population or go to fixation, and what changes cause birth and death of new killers over evolutionary time. During her PhD, she addressed the Spore killers from a comparative and population genomics perspective. Lore is also greatly interested in molecular systematics, population genetics, speciation, and mating dynamics of lichenized fungal and marine invertebrates. She is now moving on for a postdoc at Stockholm University.
